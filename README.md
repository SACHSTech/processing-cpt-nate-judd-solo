# Skyline Speedster

Skyline Speedster is a platformer game where the character has to jump from platform to platform up in the sky above the tallest buildings. There are multiple levels and a sidescrolling effect when moving left and right. While jumping from platform to platform the player has to avoid being caught by birds. The goal of each level is to pick up the key and make it to the exit. Besides being able to move left and right, the character can jump, crouch, dash, and sprint. The first level acts as a tutorial that will show the player the controls of game and allow the player to get used to the movement.
